Mathstodon is a fork of [Tusky](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky) that suport MathJax/Latex.
And Tusky is a beautiful Android client for [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). Mastodon is an ActivityPub federated social network. That means no single entity controls the whole network, rather, like e-mail, volunteers and organisations operate their own independent servers, users from which can all interact with each other seamlessly.
